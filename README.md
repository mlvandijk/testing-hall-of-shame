Some code examples of tests (or lack thereof) that I have come across.

**Note:** Mostly examples of what **NOT** to do.


1. Run your tests
In order for your tests to be useful, you have to run them.

I've found tests that had not been run for years (!) for any number of reasons.

Find the examples in package `run_your_tests`
